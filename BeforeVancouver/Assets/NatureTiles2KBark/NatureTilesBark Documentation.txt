DemoInput: We use Mouse Scrollwheel for camera zoom within the demo provided.
In your Input Settings, be sure to have the "Mouse ScrollWheel"[case sensitive]
Input within your Project.

During development, I worked with these settings Within the Input itself:

- Name ("Mouse ScrollWheel")
- ~(1<<6) are null[blank]
- Gravity: 2.8f;
- Dead: 0.005f;
- Sensitivity; 2.4f;
- Snap: false;
- Invert: true;
- Type: Mouse Movement;
- Axis: 3rd axis;
- Joy: All Motion;

The Cinematic Camera simply takes in an anchor to move to, and the Animation name tht you would like to transition too.
All Animations work with root motion to drive the camera.
Too reuse this camera make sure you have an animator attatched with the proper animations named within, You do not need any transitions!
Just make sure the Animation node within your animator has the same name as the one within the Camera editor!!!

Also attatch a rigidbody to your camera, with gravity turned off and kinematic switched on.
This is an asset i threw together for this demo, do with it as you will.

I was planning to create a tree for each bark material for this demo and pack, if i can ever manage to make that many trees without data loss,
or frequent crashes, i will update the pack with more demo trees.
